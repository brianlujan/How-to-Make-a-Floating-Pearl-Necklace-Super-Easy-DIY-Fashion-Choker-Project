<h2> Instructions to Make the Necklace<br /></h2>
Instructions to make floating pearl choker necklace:<br />
Step 1:<br />
Take the transparent cord and measure it around your neck. Make sure it is about 2 cm shorter than your neck girth and cut it out using a pair of scissors. (Images 1 &amp; 2 of the collage)<br />
My cord measures around 32 cm.<br />
Optional: This length is for a choker but you can also make it longer. You can totally customize it as per your likes.<br />
Step 2:<br />
The is to select how many beads you want in your necklace. I will be using 11 pearl beads. If you want to use other types of beads, you can mix them also. Even black beads give a great look to the necklace.<br />
Step 3:<br />
Take your glue and put it on a surface, and take a toothpick to glue the inside of the bead. The other method is to put a glue drop on the string itself for a more professional finish. Insert the bead till the glue and rotate the bead around the glue. Let it dry.<br />

Note: Ensure to keep a little extra string about 2 cm from an end to later attach the crimp end.</p>

Step 4:<br />
Now we have to decide the space that we want to give between the beads. Mine is about 1.5 cm. You can choose your own spacing between the beads.<br />
Step 5:<br />
Start to align the beads one by one along the necklace. Complete the gluing and also ensure that about 2 cm of the cord is left at the other end for attaching the crimp end. If any access cord is left, you can cut it out. (Image 5 of the collage)<br />
Step 6:<br />
Now take two crimp ends, and using your pliers attach it to both the ends of the cord. (Image 6 of the collage)<br />
Step 7:<br />
Take about 10 jump rings and connect them to each other. to form a chain. Now attach this to the other end of the necklace. This will form an adjustable closure for the choker. (Image 7 &amp; 8 of the collage)<br />
Step 8:<br />
Take a jump ring and attach both a lobster clasp and one end of the necklace. (Image 9, 10 &amp; 11 of the collage)<br />
Voila! Your choker is now ready to wear and rock. (Image 12 of the collage)<br />
